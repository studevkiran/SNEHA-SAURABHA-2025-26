## How to Add Images

1. Save your images with the exact filenames above
2. Place them in the `images/` folder
3. The website will automatically display them

## Notes

- Images will be displayed side-by-side on the home page
- They are responsive and will scale to fit mobile screens
- If images fail to load, they will be hidden automatically
- Recommended to optimize images for web (compress before uploading)

## Current Placeholders

The website currently has fallback behavior - if images don't load, they simply don't display, and the rest of the layout adapts.

Once you add your images, refresh the page to see them!
